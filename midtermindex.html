            <li>Advanced Provisioning: A formal agreement between the user and the cloud service provider that specifies
                the type and quantity of cloud resources that are required.</li>
        </b>
        <b>
            <li>Dynamic Provisioning: The cloud service provider adds or removes resources as needed based on the demand
                or workload of the applications.</li>
        </b>
        <b>
            <li>User Self-Provisioning: The user can request and access cloud resources on demand without the
                intervention of the cloud service provider.</li>

            <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS): Going a step further, PaaS provides a full-fledged development
